## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine 

2. **Navigate to the Repository Directory**

   ```bash
   cd credit-card-fraud-detection
   ```

3. **Install the Required Libraries**

   Install the required Python libraries by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Download Dataset

Download the required dataset from Kaggle:

1. **Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset**

   Download the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

### Update Paths in the Notebook

Open the `credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb` notebook and update the paths to the downloaded dataset accordingly. 

### Run the Notebook

Run the Jupyter notebook to build and evaluate the credit card fraud detection models. 

You can start Jupyter Notebook by running:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then, open `credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb` and run all the cells.

### Run the Models Directly

If you prefer to directly run the pre-trained models, update the paths to the saved models in the appropriate sections of the code. 

Then, you can load and run the models without re-training them by executing the relevant cells in the notebook.
